Car workshop was programmed using the C++ language. A code for car workshop was programmed whose task was to store and manage the car information. Different modules were included such as storing the information of the various cars, editing, searching, deleting and then retrieving the desired car information on the basis of certain criteria. Modules related to real-life applications such as displaying car information that has come to our workshop for repair applying constraints to fields such as the mobile number and email were also included.
